I need you to perform code refactoring across several Dart files in my Flutter project. Here are the specific replacements I need:

1. Replace all instances of `Dimens.constPadding` with `ISizes.md`
2. Replace all instances of `Dimens.constWidth` with:
```dart
const SizedBox(
  width: ISizes.md,
)
```
3. Replace all instances of `Dimens.constHeight` with:
```dart
const SizedBox(
  height: ISizes.md,
)
```

For each buffer I share with you, please:
1. Scan the entire file for these patterns
2. Apply all the replacements needed
3. Let me know what changes were made in which files]]

-- Flutter Format content
local flutter_format_content = function()
  return [[### Flutter Code Formatting

Please help me format my Flutter code according to best practices. When formatting the code, please:

1. Follow the official Dart Style Guide
2. Apply Flutter-specific formatting conventions:
   - Use proper widget structure with consistent indentation
   - Format widget trees for readability (one widget per line for complex widgets)
   - Properly align parameters and trailing commas for enhanced readability
   - Extract repeated widgets into reusable variables or methods
   - Use const constructors where appropriate
   - Format string interpolation consistently
   - Apply proper spacing around operators, brackets, and parentheses
   - Organize import statements according to best practices
   - Add proper documentation for public APIs

3. WITHOUT changing any functional behavior, improve code:
   - Remove redundant code
   - Fix any style issues
   - Improve naming if unclear
   - Simplify complex expressions
   - Apply proper nullable handling practices

Let me know you're ready, and I'll share my Flutter code with you.]]

-- Theme Migration content
local theme_migration_content = function()
  return [[### Flutter Theme Migration

I need help transitioning our app's styling approach from using direct AppTextStyles references to using Flutter's ThemeData with extensions. Here's my specific request:

1. Please analyze two files:
   - `/home/nihal/dev/flutter/works/raf-pharmacy/lib/resources/app_textstyles.dart` (our current styling approach)
   - `/home/nihal/dev/flutter/works/innsof_ecommerce/lib/utils/theme/widget_themes/text_theme.dart` (the theme implementation we want to use)

2. Once you've analyzed them, I need you to convert text style references in our UI files (buffers I'll share) from using the AppTextStyles approach to using the context.textTheme extension method.

3. Implementation requirements:
   - Replace all instances of AppTextStyles with context.textTheme.[appropriate style]
   - Make sure to use the textTheme extension method on the BuildContext (context) to access styles
   - Preserve font weight settings by using .copyWith(fontWeight: FontWeight.w###) where necessary
   - If TextStyle has other properties in AppTextStyles, also include those in the copyWith

4. I'll share multiple files sequentially. For each one:
   - Analyze the current usage of AppTextStyles
   - Show me the complete updated code using the theme approach
   - Apply the changes to the buffer when requested

Please first examine the two reference files I mentioned so you understand both approaches thoroughly before making changes.]]

2. `/home/nihal/dev/flutter/works/innsof_ecommerce/lib/utils/theme/widget_themes/text_theme.dart`

Provide a mapping between the styles in AppTextStyles and the equivalent in the textTheme extension approach, explaining how you'll transform them.]]
